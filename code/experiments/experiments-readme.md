# Experiments

This directory contains the two experiments appearing in this CogSci paper. Each subdirectory contains all the necessary code (i.e., HTML/CSS/JavaScript) to run the experiments locally. 

### Running the Experiments
Experiments can be run locally in the following way:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the desired experiment (`s1_quicksand` or `s2_quicksand`).
2. Run the following command in your terminal: `python3 -m http.server`
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
